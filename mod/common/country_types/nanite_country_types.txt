# Example:
# name_of_country_type = {
#	can_own_empty_planets					# No by default, decides if empty planets belonging to country are automatically removed from the country.

# 	has_complete_sensor = no				# Default no, if yes then empire has complete sensor of the galaxy.
#	has_capital = yes						# Default is yes, capital always exists but toggling this no hides any mention of the capital planet being a capital.

#	destroys_starbases = no					# If this is set to yes, country will destroy starbases instead of disabling them.
